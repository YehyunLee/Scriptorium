A Prisma schema defining your data models
An existing TypeScript backend from part 1
Need to build a React+TypeScript frontend
Need to containerize code execution with Docker
Need to implement pagination, proper UI/UX, and pre-populated data
Your approach of converting JS endpoints to TS one by one while building the frontend is sensible. Let's tackle this systematically:

For each feature we implement on the frontend, we'll:

Review/convert the related backend endpoint to TypeScript
Create proper DTO/interface types shared between frontend/backend
Implement the React component with TypeScript
Add proper error handling and loading states
Ensure responsive design with Tailwind
Key technical considerations:

Use React Router for navigation
Implement proper auth flow with JWT
Set up Docker for code execution
Add pagination for lists
Create reusable components
Add proper TypeScript types throughout
Would you like to start with a specific feature? For example:

Auth system (login/register)
Code editor/execution
Templates listing/creation
Blog posts
Comments system
Let me know which feature you'd like to tackle first and I can help with the TypeScript conversion and frontend implementation.
